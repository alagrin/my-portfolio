        Hello! I'm a passionate developer with experience in ReactJS, HTML/CSS, Java, SQL after my 4 years of working over at GM on 
        the E-Commerce side of the business.
        I love working on all sorts of web development and am always eager to learn new technologies.
        When I'm not coding, you can find me playing music, tennis, hanging out at the latest food trucks and food spots out in Austin.
      </p>
